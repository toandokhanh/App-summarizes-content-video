This is a picture of Hanoi on February 25 2023, and this is a picture at the Van Bao Ha Dong Primary School in Hanoi.
Recently, more than 400 parents waited all night in front of the school gate for their children to enter grade 1 episode 1, and this is pictures at Van Bao Ha Dong Primary School Hanoi.
Recently, more than 4 pages of parents waiting all night in front of the school gate to enter grade 1.
What do you guys think about the pictures at 5 pm yesterday?
Everyone has been busy First of all, already got here in line already when I got here.
It was around 9 pm, it was already 9 and there was already a group of people to register the suicide number together.
It was the parent group, not the school this morning, 4:45.
This is the scene of applying for admission to class 1 in Hanoi in 2023.
Why do you play this scene every year in the educational environment in the 4 0 era, but in primary school just choose a school that is convenient to pick up and go home?
Why do you have to fight and spend your career so hard?
Please give me a satisfactory explanation: why it's not like that we always have policies and support.
This situation is happening in many other localities as much as possible to universalize education, but these are the pictures shared on June 19 at a school that held 1st grade enrollment in the city.
This Ho Chi Minh City.
